# 🍃 Potato Leaf Disease Classification

An end-to-end deep learning project for classifying potato plant leaf images into **Healthy** or **Diseased** categories.  
This project demonstrates **computer vision expertise**, **model deployment**, and **cloud-ready architecture** for agricultural AI solutions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Potato crops are highly susceptible to fungal and bacterial infections. Early detection of leaf diseases helps farmers reduce crop loss and optimize pesticide usage.  
This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify potato leaf images with **97.68% accuracy**.

Key Features:
- 📂 **Image Classification** using CNN (trained from scratch, no pre-trained models)
- 🖼️ **Image Augmentation** to improve model generalization
- 🔍 Real-time **disease detection** with uploaded images
- 🌐 **User-friendly web app** built with Flask
- ☁️ **Production-ready architecture** (Dockerized & deployable on AWS)
